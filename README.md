# code_refractor

## This is my first homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class. It is a website for an SEO (Search Enginge Optimization) but the HTML and CSS code needed to be cleaned up. The goal is to make the HTML/CSS more semantic and easier for, here it comes, search engine optimization.

## Usage
### How do you use this project? You may use it nearly anyway you see fit however, if you feel lost, scared and alone; I have some suggestions for you. 
 1. You may admire it, sit back and take in the beauty. Peruse through the code. Enjoy it as if it were an old coletrain record, Bach or Monet. So, I might not be quite there yet but not every note written by Bach was divined, Coletain didn't start out great and in the beginning Monet's art looked like everyone elses at the time.
 2. You can judge it. You can critisize and even give useful feedback. How can I improve? Do you know how to write code as beautiful as Monet paints- I want to know your secrets.
 3. You can x out. You came here by accident and only realized right now you weren't suppose to be here. So, it's cool. Have a good night. 

 ## Credits

I would like to thank Kerwin, Jerome and all my classmates for helping and anyone that contributed to make the base code.
