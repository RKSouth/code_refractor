theres a section in the good read me example that says "At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here." -->
### The goal of this project was to make the code more concise, semmantically correct and usable for search engine optimization. I did this to better understand what good code looks and feels like, to work on developing strong habits of commenting, commiting, and continous improvement. Making code smaller, easier to read and more agile for the user is what turns smart men into rich men-and me into a better observer and practioner of creating well, written and optimized code. Knowing that it needs to happen is not enough, practicing is the only way. 
## Features 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

1. Converted all HTML elements into semantic terms
2. Re-ordered the elements to follow a logical structure (HTML)
3. Added alt attrivutes to all image elements so that they meet accessibility standards
4. Re-ordered heading attributes so they follow in sequential order
5. Gave the website a concise, descriptive title

## Usage
### How do you use this project? You may use it nearly anyway you see fit however, if you feel lost, scared and alone; I have some suggestions for you. 
 1. You may admire it, sit back and take in the beauty. Peruse through the code. Enjoy it as if it were an old coletrain record, Bach or Monet. So, I might not be quite there yet but not every note written by Bach was divined, Coletain didn't start out great and in the beginning Monet's art looked like everyone elses at the time.
 2. You can judge it. You can critisize and even give useful feedback. How can I improve? Do you know how to write code as beautiful as Monet paints- I want to know your secrets.
 3. You can x out. You came here by accident and only realized right now you weren't suppose to be here. So, it's cool. Have a good night. 

 ## Credits

I would like to thank Kerwin, Jerome and all my classmates for helping and anyone that contributed to make the base code.
